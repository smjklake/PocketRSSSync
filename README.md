# Pocket RSS Sync
This is a small for-fun project that helped me make a product I use more useful to me. I was looking for a way to consume articles that didn't include paywalls and advertisements. I decided to use Mozilla's Pocket as I like the UI, app, and browser integrations that exist currently. This project is a tool to allow me to automatically deliver RSS feeds to my pocket account.
This is a toy project and is far from finished.
